# DenseUNet-K
Pytorch Implementation for Simplified DenseNet Architecture for Image-to-Image Translation

----------------------------------
Simplified DenseNet Architecture
----------------------------------
Fully Convolutional DenseNet architecture with fixed number of channels throughout the network. \
Skip Connections from Encoder to Decoder layers at multiple resolutions \
Reduced number of parameters. \
Useful for: Image-to-Image Transformation, Image-Segmentation.
